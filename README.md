# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This is a repo that contains all the Front-end development exercises done during [Optimum BH](https://github.com/optimumBA) Internship.

Exercises are based on [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Getting started

1. fork this repo
2. create an exercise branch based on remote branch (e.g. `qr_code_component`)
3. edit files inside challenge directory (e.g. `challenges/qr_code_component`) and add any images to its own `images` subdirectory while previewing it on the server (execute `npm run serve` command)
4. make sure your solution passes tests (execute `npm run test` command)
5. create PR to the matching upstream branch
6. make sure it passes code review
7. merge your exercise branch with your main branch
8. update main `index.html` file to include link to the newest challenge solution
9. enable GitHub Actions for your repo to enable deployment to GitHub Pages
10. repeat steps 2-8 for each exercise
11. you can also improve main `index.html` file

Each challenge has its own directory inside `challenges` that contains HTML file, Tailwind CSS config file and input CSS file just like Tailwind Playground does. Directory `public` is for output only and can be ignored.
