Exercises are based on [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Getting started

1. fork this repo
2. enable GitHub Actions for your fork
3. create an exercise branch based on remote branch (e.g. `qr_code_component`)
4. find corresponding challenge on https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges and download starter files
5. read the instructions
6. edit files inside challenge directory (e.g. `challenges/qr_code_component`) and add any images to its own `images` subdirectory while previewing it on the server (execute `npm run serve` command)
7. make sure your solution passes tests (execute `npm run test` command)
8. create PR to the matching upstream branch
9. make sure it passes code review
10. merge your exercise branch with your main branch
11. update main `index.html` file (`challenges/index.html`) in your `main` branch to include link to the newest challenge solution
12. repeat steps 3-11 for each exercise
13. you can also improve UI of the main `index.html` file
14. set `gh-pages` branch as GitHub Pages Source
15. open your site at https://USERNAME.github.io/frontend_mentor_challenges/

Each challenge has its own directory inside `challenges` that contains HTML file, Tailwind CSS config file and input CSS file just like Tailwind Playground does. Directory `public` is for output only and can be ignored.
